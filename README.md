# KubeStellar Helm Repository

Hello world!  I'm a potential Helm repository for KubeStellar charts.

Visit [the KubeStellar website](https://kubestellar.io) to learn about KubeStellar.

To see a simple example of setting up and using KubeStellar, see [its quickstart](https://docs.kubestellar.io/latest/direct/get-started/). That includes using its "Core" Helm chart. There is also [full documentation of that chart](https://docs.kubestellar.io/latest/direct/core-chart/).

Note: this repository was used for Helm charts for older releases of KubeStellar. Be sure to visit [the KubeStellar website](https://kubestellar.io) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar) for information about newer releases.
